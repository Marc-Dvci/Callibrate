"""The CALL-E adapter: one contract in, one call placed, one body of evidence out.

This is the only place in Callibrate that knows CALL-E exists. It does five
things and deliberately does not do a sixth.

1. Renders a Verification Contract into the goal CALL-E is given, including the
   disclosure, the readback rule, and the conditions under which CALL-E should
   stop the call.
2. Plans the call with `plan_call`, which never dials.
3. Starts it with `run_call`, after the call-eligibility gate upstream has
   already said yes.
4. Follows the run to a terminal status with `get_call_run`, persisting the
   `run_id` before the first poll so a restart resumes instead of redialling.
5. Normalises the transcript and hands it to the deterministic reader.

The sixth thing is business policy. This adapter never decides whether a record
may change. It cannot: it returns `CallEvidence`, and `CallEvidence` authorises
nothing.
