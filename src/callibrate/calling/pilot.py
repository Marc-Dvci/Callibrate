"""The pilot line: a scripted conversation, read by the production evidence rules.

Every hackathon build needs a way to exercise the parts of a system that a real
phone call is too slow, too expensive and too rude to exercise a hundred times.
The pilot line is that: a set of scripted conversations in CALL-E's own
transcript shape, replayed through the same normaliser, the same readback
corroborator, the same reconciler and the same policy as a real CALL-E run.

Two rules keep it honest.

**It is never presented as a real call.** `is_live` is false, the caller name it
writes into the ledger is `pilot-line`, and the console labels the run.

**It gets no shortcuts.** It returns raw turns, not evidence. If the transcript
reader cannot find a readback in a pilot script, the pilot script does not get
its update either. Two of the scripts below exist precisely to fail.
