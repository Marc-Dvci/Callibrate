"""Corroborating a readback against the conversation it happened in.

A caller can report that it read a value back and the provider agreed. That
report is the strongest single input the tier policy takes, because it is what
lets a low-judgment field publish without a curator. So it cannot be taken on
the caller's word: until this module runs, the caller is a witness to its own
call.

Nothing here asks a model anything. It reads the recorded transcript and looks
for the exchange the report claims happened, which is three turns in order:

1. the **provider** says the new thing, in their own words;
2. the **assistant** says the whole value back to them, and nothing the value
   does not hold;
3. the **provider** agrees, without hedging or correcting.

All three are required, and the order is required. Two of them are not enough:
an assistant that reads out what the record already holds and gets "the phone
number is right, but the hours moved" has been corrected, not confirmed, and a
value nobody said first is a value the caller brought to the call itself.

The second condition is two-sided on purpose. A readback that says more than the
value is agreed to as a whole and recorded in part, so "Tuesdays ten to twelve
and Thursdays one to three" is a faithful readback of a conversation and not a
readback of `TU,TH 10:00-12:00`.

Three properties are deliberate.

**It fails towards a person.** Spoken language is not going to normalise cleanly
onto a canonical value every time, so this will sometimes fail to find a
readback that did occur. That costs a curator thirty seconds. The opposite error
publishes a wrong address for a food pantry, so the asymmetry is the whole point
and the thresholds are set for it.

**It reads the stored transcript**, the same redacted text a curator will later
read. So its verdict is reproducible from what the ledger holds, rather than
from something transient that only existed inside one call. One consequence
follows and is not a bug: `redact_pii` masks phone numbers, so a phone readback
cannot be corroborated from the record, and a phone change from a live call
always goes to a curator.

**It only ever removes confidence.** A corroborated readback does not make a
change safe; it makes it eligible for the evidence policy to consider, which
then applies its own rules about removals, high-judgment fields and canonical
form.
