"""Turning a finished call into evidence, with two readings that must agree.

A CALL-E run comes back with two different kinds of thing: a transcript of what
was said, and the caller's own account of what it achieved. The account is
useful and it is not evidence, because it was written by the participant whose
work is being checked.

So this module reads the transcript itself, by rule, and produces its own
candidate value for every field under contract. Then it reconciles:

    transcript candidate  +  caller account  agree     -> a supported claim
    transcript candidate  +  caller account  disagree  -> a claim, flagged, to a curator
    transcript candidate  +  no account                -> a supported claim
    no transcript candidate + caller account           -> a claim with no evidence, to a curator
    neither                                            -> an unresolved question

Nothing here can make a claim safer than the transcript makes it. Every branch
either keeps the transcript's verdict or lowers it, which is the property the
whole product rests on: a call that goes badly cannot leave the record in a
worse state than a call that never happened.
