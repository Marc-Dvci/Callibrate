"""The spoken vocabulary, and the scanners that read one sentence for its parts.

Two modules read the same English from opposite ends. `transcript.py` turns a
provider's sentence into a candidate record value; `readback.py` checks an
assistant's sentence against a value that already exists. They have to agree
about what a sentence contains. If one of them can see a day or a clock time the
other cannot, a value can be proposed out of half a sentence and then read back
as though it were the whole of it, which is the one failure this system is built
to make impossible. So the lexicon and both scanners live here, and neither
reader keeps its own.
