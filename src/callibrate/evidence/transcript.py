"""Reading a CALL-E transcript without asking anything to interpret it.

Two jobs live here.

**Normalising.** CALL-E returns turns labelled `bot` and `user`. On an outbound
verification call the `user` is the person who picked up the provider's phone,
so `user` becomes `provider` and `bot` becomes `assistant`. Getting this wrong is
not cosmetic: the readback corroborator looks for a *provider* agreeing with an
*assistant*, so a mislabelled transcript silently stops every automatic update
without anything failing. Each turn gets a stable id, and free text is redacted
before it is stored.

**Proposing.** Spoken language has to become a canonical record value before
anything can be compared with the record. "ten until one on Wednesdays" has to
become `WE 10:00-13:00`, or the two are not comparable and the whole verification
is a vibe. That conversion happens here, from the transcript alone, by rule.

Everything in this module is deliberately conservative. A sentence it cannot
parse produces no candidate, which sends the field to a curator. It never
guesses a value in order to have one.
