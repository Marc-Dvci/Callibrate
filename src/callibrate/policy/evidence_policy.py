"""Where evidence becomes authority, or does not.

    AI proposes facts. Deterministic software grants authority.

Everything upstream produces `CallEvidence`. This module is the only thing that
turns evidence into permission to write, and it is a few hundred lines of rules
with no model in them. Four verdicts, in increasing severity, and the run takes
the highest one any single claim reached:

    REFRESH  the provider confirmed what we publish; move the date, change nothing
    APPLY    an explicit, read-back, confirmed change to a low-judgment field
    REVIEW   anything a person should look at before the public sees it
    STOP     end the call, suppress the number, tell a person

The ordering matters more than the names. `max()` over the verdicts of a run is
the run's verdict, so a single unresolved claim pulls the whole run to REVIEW.
That is the behaviour you want: a run that got four things right and one thing
ambiguous is not four fifths safe.
